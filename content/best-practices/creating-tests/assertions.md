# At least one assertion per test


Each test should contain at least one assertion method. You should avoid cases when the body of a test contains no assertion method or is empty. Unit test frameworks usually report such tests as passed which leads to false results.

# Only one assertion per test

Opinions on this best practice are not uniform and a lot of authors have different opinions on it. Books [(Meszaros 2007, chap. 5. Principles of Test Automation)](#978-0-13-149505-0), [(Powerhouse 2018, chap. 6. Why JUnit does not report all the failures in a single test)](#978-1-976900-84-6) and [(Acharya 2014, chap. 10.Best  Practices-Working with assertions)](#978-1-78398-251-6-978-1-78398-250-9) are quite strict about it and they always require only one assertion per test. In their mind, if a test contains multiple assertions it should be split into multiple test methods. Generally, they think that having multiple assertions in a test has an impact on readability and also makes maintenance trickier.

On the other hand authors [(Martin 2009, chap. 9. Unit Tests)](#978-0-13-235088-4), [(Khorikov 2020, chap. 3.1.5 How many assertions should the assert section hold?)](#978-1-61729-627-7), [(Langr a Swaine 2013, chap. 7. Quality Tests-One Assert per Test) ](#978-1-937785-48-2) a
[(Tarlinder 2016)](#978-0-13-429106-2), [(Turnquist a Das 2018, chap. What is the right size for a test method?)](#978-1-78728-150-9) think that the rule is way too strict and that we should think about the whole thing differently. Rather than aiming for one assertion method, we should aim for testing one behaviour per test. Testing one behaviour per test can lead to multiple different outputs and it is ok to use multiple assertions to check them. In other words, a number of assertion methods should not be caused by mixing multiple test cases together but more of an unavoidable thing to test one behaviour. In general, however, the authors hold the view that a number of assertions should not be mindlessly increased and it should be kept as low as possible.

Regarding multiple assertion methods it is also important to realize one additional problem. A lot of unit testing frameworks, for example JUnit, will fail the whole test even if just one assertion method fails. This is a big problem, because even if the test is testing just one behaviour using multiple assertion methods, the result of it is misleading and it does not provide overview of all the errors. In order to get information about all the errors assertions has to be commented out one by one and test has to be repeatedly executed. Solution is either limit number of assertion errors to one or use special assertions which allow asserting multiple things in a batch. One example is the method assertAll(), that is available for the testing framework JUnit version 5 [(García 2017, chap. Jupiter assertions)](#978-1-78712-439-4).

# Do not use Guard Assertions

One of the most common errors in the code is sudden exception like *NullPointerException* or *IndexOutOfBoundsException*. For this reason programmers add extra check which would prevent such situations. In tests such checks are redundant because the test would fail and the error message would be part of the result report. Therefore it is recommended to avoid such redundant checks, because they add no value to the test and they make the whole test longer and harder to understand [(Koskela 2013, chap. 4.9. Overprotective tests)](#978-1-935182-57-3).

# Keep the right order of the assertion method parameters

Expected value should always be custom test data and actual value the value returned by the system under the test. It is a small mistake but can lead to big problems [(Acharya 2014, chap. 10. Best Practices-Working with assertions)](#978-1-78398-251-6-978-1-78398-250-9).

# Use messages describing the error

If it is possible it is recommended to add some additional messages exaplaining the error to the assertion methods. The message will then make it easier to understand what is the error about [(Hamill 2004, chap. 4. Writing Unit Tests-Types of Asserts)](#978-0-596-00689-1).

# Create custom assertions methods

In specific cases it is recommended to create a custom assertion methods. This approach helps readibility of the tests and prevents code duplications[(Hamill 2004, kap. 4. Writing Unit Tests-Defining Custom Asserts)](#978-0-596-00689-1). It is recommended to use this approach if there is same sequence of assertions across multiple tests. Such sequence can be then extracted into a separate class or method [(Govindaraj 2015, kap. 6. Maintaining Your Test Suite-Writing tests closer to the domain)](#978-1-78398-792-4).

# Keep the assertions simple

It is recommended to avoid overly complicated assertion methods, that do not imply what is asserted. It is very hard to understand such methods and they are also very unstable and even simple change can lead to a failure. Book [(Koskela 2013, chap. 4.2 Hyperassertions) ](#978-1-935182-57-3) calls such assertions Hyperassertions and
gives an example of an assertions that compares content of a file with content of a file produced filed after transformation (img. 2).
