<h1 id="definition-of-the-term-best-practices">Definition of the term "Best Practices"</h1>
The Cambridge Dictionary defines the term Best Practice as follows:

> „A working method or set of working methods that is officially accepted as being the best to use in a particular business or industry, usually described formally and in detail.“ [(Cambridge Dictionary 2020)](#Best_practice_definition_cambridge_dictionary_2020)

The definition from the Merriam-Webster web portal is a bit more specific and defines the term as follows:

> „A procedure that has been shown by research and experience to produce optimal results and that is established or proposed as a standard suitable for widespread adoption.“ [(Merriam-Webster 1927)](#Best_practice_definition_merriam_webster_1927)

As we can see, the second definition is a bit more specific and does not only speak in abstract terms of the general acceptance of the method, but suggests that this status has
been gained through previous research and good experience from its application to other projects.
